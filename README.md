# Predicting-Bank-Loan-Eligibility-Using-Machine-Learning-Models-
The project aims to develop a loan eligibility prediction model using Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, CatBoost, and XGBoost algorithms. By comparing their performance, we aim to select the most suitable model ensuring robustness and accuracy for assisting financial institutions in automating the loan approval process.
